Hi! Thanks for checking out the lowendlibre project.

### Who are we?

This project is headed by [justsoup](https://mstdn.social/@justsoup) and [hexaheximal](https://mstdn.social/@hexaheximal@mastodon.social). Our main goal is to bring the mobile Linux ecosystem to low-end and generally MediaTek based devices. lowendlibre was founded on July 10, 2023 when our two separate projects merged with the same goal in mind. Linux.
